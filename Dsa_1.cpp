/* about this code


In the shortened version, the following changes were made:

Removed the separate arrays for linear probing and quadratic probing, and merged them into a single array for simplicity.
Replaced the separate linear probing and quadratic probing functions with a single probing() function that handles both techniques.
Removed the unused q_roll, q_name, and q_comp arrays.
Replaced the constant value 10 with the SIZE constant.
Simplified the insertion process by directly calling the probing() function from the insert() function.
Removed the opt


Certainly! Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code, along with the concepts used:

The code includes the necessary header files (iostream, iomanip, and string) for input/output operations, formatting, and string manipulation.

The Hash class is defined to encapsulate the hash table functionality.

Within the Hash class, there are private member variables: roll (array to store roll numbers), name (array to store student names), comp (array to store the number of comparisons), and count (to keep track of the number of records inserted).

The Hash class contains public member functions:

insert() to allow the user to input roll number and name for a student and call the probing() function for insertion.
display() to display the hash table.
compare() to calculate and display the total number of comparisons and the average number of comparisons per key.
The Hash class also contains a private member function:

probing() for handling the linear probing technique. It takes the roll number, name, and initial index for insertion. It performs linear probing by incrementing the index until an available slot is found, and then inserts the data into the arrays.
In the main() function:

An instance of the Hash class (h) is created.
A while loop is used to present a menu to the user until the user chooses to exit.
The user's choice is read using cin.
A switch statement is used to perform actions based on the user's choice:
Case 1: Calls the insert() function.
Case 2: Calls the display() function.
Case 3: Calls the compare() function.
Case 4: Exits the program.
Default: Displays an error message for an invalid option.
The code also includes a constant variable SIZE to define the size of the hash table array.

Concepts used in the code:

Classes and objects: The code defines a class Hash to encapsulate the hash table functionality and creates an object of that class in the main() function.

Arrays: Arrays are used to store the roll numbers, names, and comparison counts in the hash table.

Modulo operator (%): The modulo operator is used to calculate the index for insertion into the hash table.

Control flow: Loops (while loop) and conditional statements (switch statement) are used to control the program's flow based on user input.

Input/output operations: The code uses cout for output and cin for input to interact with the user.

String manipulation: The code uses string variables to store student names and perform input/output operations involving names.

Error handling: The code includes default cases in the switch statement to handle invalid user input.
